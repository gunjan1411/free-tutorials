    <h2>&#187;history of chess:)</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>

        The history of chess goes back almost 1500 years. The game originated in northern India in the 6th century AD
        and spread to Persia. When the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently,
        through the Moorish conquest of Spain, spread to Southern Europe.[1][2] But in early Russia, the game came
        directly from the Khanates (muslim territories) to the south.[3]

        In Europe, the moves of the pieces changed in the 15th century. The modern game starts with these changes. In
        the second half of the 19th century, modern tournament play began. Chess clocks were first used in 1883, and the
        first world chess championship was held in 1886. The 20th century saw advances in chess theory, and the
        establishment of the World Chess Federation (FIDE).[4] Chess engines (programs that play chess), and chess data
        bases became important

    </h2>
    <p>
        Chess is a recreational and competitive board game played between two players. It is sometimes called Western or
        international chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi. The current form of the game emerged
        in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from similar, much older games of
        Indian and Persian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people
        worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments.

        Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on a square chessboard with
        64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the
        other controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two
        bishops, and eight pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under
        immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end
        in a draw.

        Organized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE
        (International Chess Federation). The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz,
        claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion. A huge body of chess theory has
        developed since the game's inception. Aspects of art are found in chess composition; and chess in its turn
        influenced Western culture and art and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science,
        and psychology.

        One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep Blue became
        the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today's chess
        engines are significantly stronger than even the best human players, and have deeply influenced the development
        of chess theory.
